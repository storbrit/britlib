# Britlib

Library for my mods.

## Planned features

- Block type generation (e.g. wood blocks, stone blocks)
    - Patching block types of other mods (for example, if a mod were to add a new wood block, it would be applied
      automatically to all vanilla and modded wood types)
- Block and item registration system involving ARRP
